3,Apollo Neuroscience,Remote,Data Scientist,"Apollo Neuroscience is pioneering new ways to empower people to live healthier lives by addressing the root of stress and anxiety: the nervous system. Balancing and calming the nervous system is essential to building resilience to stress. Originating from research in neuroscience and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, Apollo Neuro, our debut product, is the first scientifically validated technology to improve the body’s resilience to stress. Unlike most other wearables, ours is not a biometric tracker; it is a wearable therapeutic that uses vibration to support the body’s recovery from stress.
We launched in January 2020 and have since grown to about 50 employees, raised our Series A, and completed six clinical trials. We’re now looking to make further investments in product development across software and hardware to build a premium experience that is even more intuitive and delightful to use.
Our company culture is built on a deep and genuine commitment to improving access to mental health. We’re a growing start-up, and empathy is our most important shared value. From that, we foster kindness and inclusion to create a respectful and friendly working environment. Our departments function collaboratively and intimately to build rapport and support individuals. We’re an entirely remote team, distributed worldwide with roots in Pittsburgh and the Bay Area.
